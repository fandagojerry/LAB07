	<h3 class="gridr2">film</h3>
	<p class="gridr2">My first official paid job was as a camp counselor and photographer at the Chatham Hall summer camps (held at my high school). I had various volunteer jobs before then, including as a film camp counselor, another camp counselor, a production assistant, and more. This past summer I worked as a paid counselor at Indiana University’s Digital Cinema Academy camp teaching high school students about film and videography.</p>

     <h3>film</h3>
     <p>Last fall, I studied abroad in London, and I had an internship at a firm
      that interviews film stars and filmmakers for promo for films, and edits
      them into YouTube videos. I had the chance to interview stars, directors,
      and producers for a film festival in junket setting (sitting down in a room
      with the movie poster behind you), as well as twice on the red carpet. I
      learned Premiere Pro like the back of my hand, and went from being the most
      awkward as an interviewer to only slightly awkward.
      </p>

     <h3>photography</h3>
     <p>I also love photography and the arts, and am a digital photographer, though
      I love working with film photography as well. My sophomore year, I took an
      Art History class about early photography, and we took frequent trips to the
      Eastman Museum as part of the course. For a final project in that class,
      I studied one of the nine remaining Daugerreotypes (the first form of permanent
      photography) of Fredrick Douglass, which was on loan at the Rare Books and
      Special Collections library at the time. I hope at some point in my career,
      I’ll be able to combine my passion for photography and the arts and my work
      in Digital Media.

  <h3>business</h3>
  <p> The next summer, I worked at a not-for-profit called DoSomething.org! They were in the business of creating social good by encouraging teenagers to take action on various issues ranging from environmental awareness to sexual health. I worked on the Marketing team, and that internship basically locked me into wanting to work in Marketing, as well as for an organization that dealt with something that I was really passionate about. It was really easy waking up at 7AM to go to work when I was happy to be there. The company culture was really fun, with themed Fridays, bake-offs, and pool floats everywhere. Now that I’m a senior, I’m starting the job hunt for post-graduation, so here’s hoping that I land a position with a company that cares about its employees!</p>
